# Simple Video app with text also benifits.
This is an node.js app that has a simple ui, mainly build to have peer-to-peer video along with textchat application. 
You can run this application locally by
1. "npm install"
2. (optional) "npm watch" or "npm run watch" if you want to make any changes since we need the main.js (in public folder) to be converted into bundle.js, since we need some node.js functionality in main.js.
3. "npm start" or "npm run start"
This can be viwed in the heroku app https://simple-video-text-app.herokuapp.com/
Thank you :-)
